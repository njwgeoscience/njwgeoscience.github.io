I’m currently looking for a new opportunity within the industry which will allow me to further develop my technical ability. Ideally, I’m looking to work for a mid to major sized operator which works in a variety of geologic settings allowing me to gain broad worldwide basin exposure.

As mentioned, my interests lie in reservoir modelling, quantitative interpretation and new ventures. Reservoir modelling appeals as it brings the geology and geophysics together to create the best representation of the subsurface the acquired data can produce. Model building requires effective communication, as input is required from all disciplines, geology, geophysics and engineering. This adds to the interest, as one is exposed to the whole exploration and production lifecycle. Within the current climate, when exploration activity is slow, a greater focus will be placed on enhancing the production of current fields, reservoir modelling plays a large part in that process by simulating different scenarios and tailoring recovery techniques to the specific geology. 

As a Geoscientist, who likes more of an emphasis on geology than geophysics, quantitative interpretation initially seemed daunting, however, after further research and witnessing the results from various techniques on ‘real life’ data I had been working on, I feel this subject has a lot more to offer the industry in the coming years.

For me, new ventures is all about excitement. It conjures up images of someone having a hunch, shooting seismic, finding a DHI, securing financing, drilling the prospect and finding the next big hydrocarbon province. For many, this is what motivated them into the industry and what drives them during their career. It is a part of the business I would like to be involved in one day.

I hope you find my [CV](#cv), experience and motivations interesting and I look forward to [hearing from you](#contact).
